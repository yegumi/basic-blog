This is my first Django project, and it's a simple social media blog application. While it’s still a basic version, it allows users to post content, comment on posts, like them, follow and unfollow other users, and edit their own posts.

Users can search for content and update their profile information, such as age and bio. Even though it’s just a prototype for now, I plan to build on it with more features and a better user experience as I continue learning.

Since front-end development isn't my main focus, I got some help from AI tools with the design. As a result, the interface is simple but functional. There were many features I wanted to add, but I decided to keep things simple for this version.

This is also my first GitHub repository, and I’m excited to see how I grow with version control over time.

I’m looking forward to improving this project and building more innovative applications in the future!
